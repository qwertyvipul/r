R-objects to store data
1. Vectors
2. Lists
3. Matrices
4. Arrays
5. Factors
6. Data frames


matrix(data, nrow, ncol, byrow, dimnames)
1. data - Defines the data used to fill the data elements in the matrix. The data normally appears as part of a vector
2. nrow - Specifies the number of rows to create.
3. ncol - Specifies the number of columns to create.
4. byrow - Defines the arrangement of the vector elements within the matrix. When set to TRUE, R arranges the vector elements by row.
5. dimnames - Determines the names assigned to the rows and columns.


array(data, dim, dimnames)
1. data - Defines the data used to fill the data elements in the matrix. The data normally appears as part of a vector
2. dim - Specifies the number of rows to create
3. dimnames - Determines the names assigned to the rows and columns.


Data Frames - Data Frames are tabular structures akin to matrix or a two-dimensional array in that they have rows and columns. However, data frames work more like a database. Each column represents a variable and each row a record.


mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE)
1. x - Contains the input vector
2. trim - Determines the number of observations to drop from both ends of the sorted vector
3. na.rm - Specifies whether to remove the missing values from the input vector


barplot(H, xlab, ylab, main, names.arg, col)
1. H - Supplies a vector or matrix containing numeric values used in the bar chart
2. xlab - Defines a label for the x-axis
3. ylab - Defines a label for the y-axis
4. main - Specifies a title for the chart
5. names.arg - Supplies a vector of names that appear under each bar
6. col - Contains a list of colors to use to color the bars in the graph
